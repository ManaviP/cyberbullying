# Cyberbullying Detection Project

## Overview

This project is designed to detect cyberbullying in text-based posts. It allows users to post content only if it does not contain cyberbullying. The detection mechanism is based on the Random Forest algorithm, which analyzes text data to determine if a post contains harmful content.

## Features

- **Cyberbullying Detection:** Uses a machine learning model to classify text as either safe or harmful.  
- **Content Filtering:** Prevents posts that contain cyberbullying from being published.  
- **Machine Learning-Based Approach:** Implements the Random Forest algorithm for classification.
